On Earth, we measure the Doppler Effect with sound. Perhaps the pitch of a car coming towards you, or perhaps a person screaming running away from you. However, there are no sound waves in space therefore the Doppler Effect is measured with light wavelengths in space in order to measure the motions of entire objects. The Doppler effect occurs in space around stars and planets, as well as the sun, majority of the time. This stellar being may be orbiting around its center mass therefore causing it to move toward or away from Earth. The universe is constantly expanding, and stellar objects are constantly moving. In addition, there are many planets in the universe that we have not discovered in Earth. In fact, the Doppler Effect makes it easier to detect if a planet is in a certain location by using light wavelengths in order to detect it as well as to detect it’s motions.</p>\r\n                        </td>\r\n                    </tr>\r\n                    <tr>\r\n                        <td><b>Graphical Representations</b></td>\r\n                        <td>\r\n                            <p>2 graphs we will have are a position vs. time graph and a velocity vs. time graph.
